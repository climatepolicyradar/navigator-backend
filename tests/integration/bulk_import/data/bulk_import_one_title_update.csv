10995,6274,DOCUMENT EDIT National REDD+ Investment Plan (PNI-REDD+),"The National REDD+ Investment Plan (PNI-REDD+) presents the EN-REDD+ implementation priorities for the next ten years (2020-2030). The PNI-REDD+ establishes orderly and sustainable economic growth as a principle, which safeguards the country's valuable natural capital, fosters participation and social inclusion, and improves the living conditions of the population.<br>The PNI-REDD+ proposes to make the vision of REDD+ a reality through two impacts that combine environmental and socioeconomic benefits:<br>• reduction of country emissions from agriculture, forestry and other land uses;<br>• Improvement of the living conditions of the population thanks to economic diversification, with a sustainable approach and integrated management of the territory.<br>Specifically, the PNI-REDD+ aspires to reduce the country's emissions linked to agriculture, forestry and other land uses by 40 million tCO2eq in the year 2040, including the implementation periods (2020-2030) and capitalization (2030- 2040). Achieving such an impact requires a total budget of US$185 million.",GNQ,https://www.cafi.org/sites/default/files/2021-01/PNI-REDD%20EQ%20Guinea%20-%20Espagnol-%20FINAL%20June%202020.pdf,executive,25/12/2020|Approved||,LULUCF,,,Adaptation;Mitigation,,Plan,2020,Spanish,,Equatorial Guinea,,

10993,6272,National Strategy REDD+ for Equatorial Guinea,"EN-REDD+ has as a long-term objective ""to contribute to the global fight against climate change and to the country's sectoral development to achieve the well-being of the Equatorial Guinean people through REDD+, with an approach based on competitiveness, sustainability, integrated land management, food security, and social and gender equity”. EN-REDD+ will contribute<br>for the country to achieve the climate objectives stipulated in its planned contributions determined at the national level (CPDN) and the development objectives established in the National Economic and Social Development Plan (PNDES) Horizon 2020 (RGE, 2007).<br>The EN-REDD+ sets ambitious goals to meet its objectives: 1) reduce GHG emissions linked to agriculture, forestry and other land uses (AFOLU) by 20% by 2030, and in 50% by the year 2050; 2) maintain the forest area around 93% of the national territory; 3) reduce the rate of forest degradation to 0.45% per year; 4) strengthen the National System of Protected Areas (SNAP); 5) increase the area of productive forests with sustainable management plans up to 80% by the year 2030; 6) achieve sustainability and improve the efficiency of the forestry and agricultural sectors; and 7) mitigate and compensate the possible negative consequences for forests of future productive activities.<br>REDD+ is part of the national structure of fight against climate change, which includes both adaptation to climate change and mitigation of its effects. The implementation of the REDD+ process will be guided by the principles of good governance: accountability, effectiveness, efficiency, equity, participation and transparency, as well as the application of a multisectoral and territorial development approach.<br>Said implementation will be the responsibility of a REDD+ Steering Committee (CP-REDD+) and a REDD+ National Coordination (CN-REDD+), which will act as the entity responsible for governance and as the technical executive body, respectively.<br>To achieve its objectives, the country plans to develop policies&nbsp;and measures for REDD+ structured in eight strategic axes. Four of them are sectoral axes, whose objective is to achieve sustainable productive development, which in turn makes it possible to mitigate the direct causes of deforestation and forest degradation, and four are cross-cutting axes, which will address the underlying causes.",GNQ,http://extwprlegs1.fao.org/docs/pdf/eqg202932.pdf,executive,01/01/2019|Approved||,LULUCF,Nature based solutions and ecosystem restoration|Direct Investment,,Adaptation;Mitigation,,Strategy,2019,Spanish,,Equatorial Guinea,,
