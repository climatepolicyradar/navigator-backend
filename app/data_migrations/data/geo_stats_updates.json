    "legislative_process": "<p> In China, <em>&lsquo;laws&rsquo; (法律)</em> are only issued by the National People&rsquo;s Congress (NPC) and its Standing Committee (NPCSC). However, &lsquo;legislation&rsquo; as governed under the <a href=\"http://www.pkulaw.cn/fulltext_form.aspx?Gid=5159701\">Law on Legislation</a> (中华人民共和国立法法) also includes regulations and rules, which may be issued by other executive bodies.  </p> <p> In relation to climate, the <a href=\"http://www.gov.cn/guoqing/2018-03/22/content_5276318.htm\">Constitution</a> (as amended in 2018) sets a national development vision, which amongst other aims, plans to create an &ldquo;ecological civilisation&rdquo; (生态文明建设). Article 89(6) of the Constitution allocates responsibility to the State Council of the Central People&rsquo;s Government to implement this goal (<a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/transnational-environmental-law/article/abs/rule-of-climate-policy-how-do-chinese-judges-contribute-to-climate-governance-without-climate-law/41A922D370E2E373389F521BEE54511F\">Zhu, 2021</a>). Therefore, the majority of Chinese climate policy tends to be formulated through &lsquo;legislation&rsquo; (executive policies), as opposed to formal &lsquo;laws&rsquo;.  </p> <p> Under Article 72 of the <a href=\"http://www.pkulaw.cn/fulltext_form.aspx?Gid=5159701\">Law on Legislation</a>, the State Council has the authority to issue <em>&lsquo;administrative regulations&rsquo; (行政法规)</em> for the following purposes: (1) to implement laws <em>(实施条例)</em>; (2) to exercise its own powers and functions provided by Article 89 of the Constitution (<a href=\"https://blogs.loc.gov/law/2020/01/a-guide-to-chinese-legal-research-administrative-regulations/\">Zhang, 2020</a>); or (3) when it has been authorized by the NPC or NPCSC to make administrative regulations on issues that should be governed by &lsquo;laws&rsquo; but where no law has yet been enacted.  </p> <p> Administrative regulations can be called <em>&lsquo;regulations&rsquo; (条例), interim regulations&rsquo; (暂行规定), &lsquo;provisions&rsquo; (规定), &lsquo;interim provisions&rsquo; (暂行规定), or &lsquo;measures&rsquo; (办法)</em> (see Article 5 of the <a href=\"http://www.gov.cn/zhengce/2020-12/26/content_5574507.htm\">Regulations on Procedures for the Formulation of Administrative Regulations</a>). Administrative regulations must be promulgated by an Order of the State Council (decree, 国务院令) and signed by the Premier (<a href=\"https://blogs.loc.gov/law/2020/01/a-guide-to-chinese-legal-research-administrative-regulations/\">Zhang, 2020</a>).  </p> <p> Ministries, Commissions, and Agencies under the State Council may issue <em>&lsquo;departmental rules&rsquo; (部门规章)</em>. These must be promulgated by orders (部令) signed by heads of the departments (<a href=\"https://blogs.loc.gov/law/2020/01/a-guide-to-chinese-legal-research-administrative-regulations/\">Zhang, 2020</a>). Departmental rules can also be named <em>&lsquo;provisions&rsquo; (规定) or &lsquo;measures&rsquo; (办法)</em>.  </p> <p> Both the State Council and the departments under it may also issue <em>&lsquo;regulatory documents&rsquo; (规范性文件)</em>. These are not regulated by the <a href=\"http://www.pkulaw.cn/fulltext_form.aspx?Gid=5159701\">Law on Legislation</a>, and thus do not have the force of law (<a href=\"https://blogs.loc.gov/law/2020/01/a-guide-to-chinese-legal-research-administrative-regulations/\">Zhang, 2020</a>). They tend to be named as &lsquo;circulars&rsquo; (通告), &lsquo;notices&rsquo; （通知）, &lsquo;decisions&rsquo; （决定） or &lsquo;opinions&rsquo; (意见), &lsquo; </p> <p> At sub-national level, the Provincial People&rsquo;s Congresses and their respective Standing Committees (provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities) may issue <em>&lsquo;local regulations&rsquo; (地方性法规)</em>. Governments of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities may formulate <em>&lsquo;local rules&rsquo; (地方政府规章)</em>.  </p> <p> The most important policy documents in China are the Five-Year Plans that set the overall direction of China&rsquo;s economy and often include high-level targets.  </p> <p> There are also certain environmental clauses in the Chinese <a href=\"http://www.npc.gov.cn/englishnpc/c23934/202012/f627aa3a4651475db936899d69419d1e/files/47c16489e186437eab3244495cb47d66.pdf\">Civil Code</a>, which entered into force on 1 January 2021. Article 9 sets out the &lsquo;ecological principle&rsquo; (<a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/transnational-environmental-law/article/abs/rule-of-climate-policy-how-do-chinese-judges-contribute-to-climate-governance-without-climate-law/41A922D370E2E373389F521BEE54511F\">Zhu, 2021</a>), Article 509(3) further stipulates that &lsquo;resource conservation and environmental protection&rsquo; is a principle of contract law (<a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/transnational-environmental-law/article/abs/rule-of-climate-policy-how-do-chinese-judges-contribute-to-climate-governance-without-climate-law/41A922D370E2E373389F521BEE54511F\">Zhu, 2021</a>). According to Zhu (2021), these are of particular relevance for climate change litigation, as many cases in China are contractual disputes.  </p>",
