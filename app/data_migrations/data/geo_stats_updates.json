However, &lsquo;legislation&rsquo; as governed under the <a href=\"http://www.pkulaw.cn/fulltext_form.aspx?Gid=5159701\">Law on Legislation</a> (中华人民共和国立法法) also includes regulations and rules, which may be issued by other executive bodies.  </p> <p> In relation to climate, the <a href=\"http://www.gov.cn/guoqing/2018-03/22/content_5276318.htm\">Constitution</a> (as amended in 2018) sets a national development vision, which amongst other aims, plans to create an &ldquo;ecological civilisation&rdquo; (生态文明建设). Article 89(6) of the Constitution allocates responsibility to the State Council of the Central People&rsquo;s Government to implement this goal (<a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/transnational-environmental-law/article/abs/rule-of-climate-policy-how-do-chinese-judges-contribute-to-climate-governance-without-climate-law/41A922D370E2E373389F521BEE54511F\">Zhu, 2021</a>). Therefore, the majority of Chinese climate policy tends to be formulated through &lsquo;legislation&rsquo; (executive policies), as opposed to formal &lsquo;laws&rsquo;.  </p> <p> Under Article 72 of the <a href=\"http://www.pkulaw.cn/fulltext_form.aspx?Gid=5159701\">Law on Legislation</a>, the State Council has the authority to issue <em>&lsquo;administrative regulations&rsquo; (行政法规)</em> for the following purposes: (1) to implement laws <em>(实施条例)</em>; (2) to exercise its own powers and functions provided by Article 89 of the Constitution (<a href=\"https://blogs.loc.gov/law/2020/01/a-guide-to-chinese-legal-research-administrative-regulations/\">Zhang, 2020</a>); or (3) when it has been authorized by the NPC or NPCSC to make administrative regulations on issues that should be governed by &lsquo;laws&rsquo; but where no law has yet been enacted.</p><p>Administrative regulations can be called <em>&lsquo;regulations&rsquo; (条例), interim regulations&rsquo; (暂行规定), &lsquo;provisions&rsquo; (规定), &lsquo;interim provisions&rsquo; (暂行规定), or &lsquo;measures&rsquo; (办法)</em> (see Article 5 of the <a href=\"http://www.gov.cn/zhengce/2020-12/26/content_5574507.htm\">Regulations on Procedures for the Formulation of Administrative Regulations</a>). Administrative regulations must be promulgated by an Order of the State Council (decree, 国务院令) and signed by the Premier (<a href=\"https://blogs.loc.gov/law/2020/01/a-guide-to-chinese-legal-research-administrative-regulations/\">Zhang, 2020</a>).</p><p>Ministries, Commissions, and Agencies under the State Council may issue <em>&lsquo;departmental rules&rsquo; (部门规章)</em>.

These are not regulated by the <a href=\"http://www.pkulaw.cn/fulltext_form.aspx?Gid=5159701\">Law on Legislation</a>, and thus do not have the force of law (<a href=\"https://blogs.loc.gov/law/2020/01/a-guide-to-chinese-legal-research-administrative-regulations/\">Zhang, 2020</a>). They tend to be named as &lsquo;circulars&rsquo; (通告), &lsquo;notices&rsquo; （通知）, &lsquo;decisions&rsquo; （决定） or &lsquo;opinions&rsquo; (意见), &lsquo;</p><p>At sub-national level, the Provincial People&rsquo;s Congresses and their respective Standing Committees (provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities) may issue <em>&lsquo;local regulations&rsquo; (地方性法规)</em>. Governments of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities may formulate <em>&lsquo;local rules&rsquo; (地方政府规章)</em>.</p><p>The most important policy documents in China are the Five-Year Plans that set the overall direction of China&rsquo;s economy and often include high-level targets.</p><p>There are also certain environmental clauses in the Chinese <a href=\"http://www.npc.gov.cn/englishnpc/c23934/202012/f627aa3a4651475db936899d69419d1e/files/47c16489e186437eab3244495cb47d66.pdf\">Civil Code</a>, which entered into force on 1 January 2021. Article 9 sets out the &lsquo;ecological principle&rsquo; (<a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/transnational-environmental-law/article/abs/rule-of-climate-policy-how-do-chinese-judges-contribute-to-climate-governance-without-climate-law/41A922D370E2E373389F521BEE54511F\">Zhu, 2021</a>), Article 509(3) further stipulates that &lsquo;resource conservation and environmental protection&rsquo; is a principle of contract law (<a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/transnational-environmental-law/article/abs/rule-of-climate-policy-how-do-chinese-judges-contribute-to-climate-governance-without-climate-law/41A922D370E2E373389F521BEE54511F\">Zhu, 2021</a>). According to Zhu (2021), these are of particular relevance for climate change litigation, as many cases in China are contractual disputes.</p>",

Korea\u2019s Acts and Subordinate Statutes form a consolidated system that is designed to prevent contradictions or conflicts.</p><p>The power to enact Acts belongs exclusively to the National Assembly, with the law-making power held by the Executive for subordinate statutes confined to matters delegated by Acts and other matters necessary to enforce Acts. Since such subordinate statutes are required to conform to Acts, the National Assembly is the supreme law-making organ. The most recent National Assembly elections took place in April 2016. The next election is expected for 2020. The last Presidential Election took place in December 2012. The next Presidential election is due to take place in 2017.</p><p>The law-making process can be initiated by the national assembly or by government representatives. In the first case, a bill is proposed by 10 or more national assembly representatives. The proposed bill is deliberated by the standing committee. After the bill passes the committee, it is referred to the plenary session. Bills that pass the plenary session will then be sent to the government to be promulgated. Bills can also be submitted by a relevant ministry. Other ministries will be consulted and a public notice will be issued. The bill is then reviewed by the Ministry of Legislation (MOLEG), an independent and specialised self-legislative control agency within the government in order to exercise overall control of and co-ordinate the government\u2019s legislative activities and to review whether individual bills contravene higher laws or conflict with relevant laws. The bill is deliberated at the State Council and sent for presidential approval. After that it is submitted to the National Assembly for decision. Once it is passed in the National Assembly, it returns to MOLEG and is finally promulgated. Presidential decrees are promulgated directly after their approval by the President and do not go through the National Assembly.</p>",

The Lower House may be dissolved at any time by the Emperor on the advice of the Prime Minister. The last general election for the House of Representatives took place in December 2014 upon the Prime Minister\u2019s decision to dissolve the Lower House. The next Lower House election is expected to take place late 2018 unless it is dissolved. The House of Councillors (the Upper House) has 242 members, elected for a six-year term \u2013 every three years half of the Upper House members are elected. The last Upper House election took place in July 2016 and the next is expected for 2019.</p><p>Japan is a parliamentary cabinet system, and more than half of cabinet members are selected from MPs by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is elected by MPs through a resolution of the Diet. MPs and the Cabinet are qualified to submit bills, and all the bills are passed to a committee for deliberation, which sometimes includes open hearings. After the committee votes on the bill, it is passed for approval to Diet plenary session in both houses. If the two chambers\u2019 votes are at odds, a conference committee is convened in an attempt to reach a compromise. After a law is passed it is promulgated by the Emperor and announced in the government gazette. The Diet also has the authority to approve the budget, ratify treaties and amend the Constitution.</p>",
